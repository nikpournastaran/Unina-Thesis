\chapter*{Abstract}

Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning, exemplified by frameworks like DeepProbLog, represents a crucial paradigm shift in Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
aiming to overcome the inherent limitations of purely deep learning models, 
particularly in tasks requiring rigorous logic. While neural networks excel at pattern recognition and fluid text generation, 
they often fail at logical consistency, 
exhibiting errors like "hallucination" and poor generalization in complex Textual Entailment and multi-hop reasoning. 
DeepProbLog integrates the pattern-learning capability of neural components with the structured, 
explainable power of Probabilistic Logic Programming, allowing the system to learn from messy data while adhering
 to explicit semantic constraints and providing a traceable, probabilistic proof for its decisions. 
 This fusion promises a new generation of NLP systems that are not only powerful but also more robust, consistent,
  and interpretable.
